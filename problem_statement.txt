There are a set of things which can be of different colours.
●Banana: Green, Yellow
●Sun: Red, Yellow
●Ink: Any colour
●Salt: White
●Sugar: White, Brownetc. 
These “Thing” objects love their own colours and whenever they
hear the name of one of their colours, they say - 
“Hey! I’m sometimes <colour>”

Build an application which takes input from the user:
●Colour Name: “red”, “white” etc.
●Add Command: “+sun”, “+ink” etc.
●Remove Command: “-sun”, “-ink”, etc.
When the user inputs - “white”, all the added “things” that
are white should speak up in a chat like format

Apart from this if the user inputs:
●exit: It should the game
●list: It should list all the things currently “added”.
Twist:
There has to be a thing called “Frog” which says:
“Frog: Ribbit! I’m <colour> today!” on all colours, if added.
